# ktracker
A period tracker in python

This is a program that allows the user to input dates where they have had their period and then uses basic statistical analysis to predict the next date that they should
expect their period to occur. 

Currently the program solely accepts user input and shows code output through the terminal in the IDE used, but there are plans for future changes to utilize libraries like tkinter or pygame to possibly create a user interface.
